<p>Developing software in early stage companies is challenging because of the
inherent uncertainty of new products, combined with limited resources. With experience
gained in hundreds of projects, we have created a <b>lean development process</b> which
lets us quickly and efficiently develop products.</p>

<p>We start with <b>user-focused product definition</b> to make sure
we are solving real problems for customers and focusing on the most important
results. We define <b>user personas</b> and <b>high level
goals</b>, then create <b>user stories</b> which identify how the product will
help make them successful. Next we define the <b>operations use
cases</b> which describe how the business "system" works and
<b>define the ideal user experience</b>.</p>

<p>When that's clear, we prioritize stories and create an initial product
iteration. We build on this base, adding use cases until we reach the product
which we can bring to market. You can use the product in development to
<b>validate the solution with customers</b>, <b>raise funding</b>, and
<b>sign up business partners</b>.</p>

<p>This gets you to product-market fit with the <b>maximum speed</b>
and <b>minimum budget</b>. We focus on the key milestones for your
business to <b>maximize your value</b> at each funding stage,
helping you to establish credibility by showing that you can get things done
and giving you more leverage. You need <b>less (or no) outside
money</b>, <b>preserving control</b> in your company.</p>
